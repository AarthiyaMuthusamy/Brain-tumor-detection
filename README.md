brain tumor detection using cnn(CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK) under deep learning.

Step 1:

import the necessary libraries like keras ,tensorflow.

step 2:

download the dataset of tumor images. link : https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1SBgJY_jRwvivQcgsIpBmDR9MavUIUQ0Q?usp=sharing https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1M9HaFmF7Grjd6ZVd29aUfCI33Qd9PE1z?usp=sharing

step 3:

we need to load the images. next split the dataset into yes and no category.

step 4:

we need to build the training model . using yes case dataset to using cnn to build the model . in cnn using max pool ,min pool, flatten , 2d transforming etc.

step 5:

After we need to find the accuracy of the model accuracy in different epochs .

step 6:

plot the graph for loss and accuracy. find accuracy of the model.

area.py:

in this code to find the exact position of tumor and also find the area of the tumor
